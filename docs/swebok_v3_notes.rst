Software Requirements Fundamentals
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Definition of a Software Requirement
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **software requirement** is a property that must be exhibited by something in
order to solve some problem in the real world.

Software requirements must be *verifiable* as an individual feature as a
functional requirement or at the system level for a nonfunctinoal requirement.

Typically, software requirements are *uniquely identified* so that they can
be subjected to software configuration management over the entire life cycle.

Product and Process Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A **product requirement** is a need or constraint on the software to be
developed.

A **process requirement** is essentially a constraint on the development of the
software (e.g. "The software shall be developed using a RUP process").

Functional and Nonfunctional Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Functional requirements** describe the functions that the software is to
execute. They are sometimes known as *capabilities* or *features*. A functional
requirement can also be described as a series of test steps that validate its
behaviour.

**Nonfunctional requirements** are the ones that act to constrain the solution.
They are sometimes known as constraints or quality requirements (attributes).
They can be further classified according to whether they are performance,
maintainability, safety, availability, security, interoperability, or many
other types of software requirements (see `Models and Quality
Characteristics`_).

Emergent Properties
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Emergent properties** are requirements that cannot be addressed by a single
component but that depend on how all the software components interoperate.

Emergent properties are crucially dependent on the *system architecture*.

Quantifiable Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Software requirements should be stated as *clearly and unambiguously* as
possible, and, where appropriate, *quantitatively*.

System Requirements and Software Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this topic, **system** means "an interacting combination of elements to
accomplish a defined objective. These include hardware, software, firmware,
people, information, techniques, facilities, services, and other support
elements."

**System requirements** are the requirements for the system as a whole.

In a system containing software components, *software* requirements are derived
from system requirements.

This KA defines **user requirements** in a restricted way, as the requirements
of the system's customers or end users. System requirements encompass user
requirements, requirements of other stakeholders, and requirements without an
identifiable human source.

Requirements Process
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Process Models
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The requirements process:

* is initiated at the beginning of a project and continues to be refined
  *throughout the life cycle*
* identifies software *requirements as configuration items*
* needs to be *adapted to the organization and product context*
